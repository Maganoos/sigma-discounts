<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->Discount Disable™ is a simple utility mod that completely disables all villager discounts.

It is required on the server but optional on the client. However, bugs may occur on the client if it is not installed, so it is generally recommended to have it installed in both environments.

Made for use on [Alinea](https://alinea.gg), but it can be used elsewhere, provided the mod is installed on the server.
